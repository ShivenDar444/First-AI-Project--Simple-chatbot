# First-AI-Project--Simple-chatbot 
Description:Python was used to create a simple chatbot project that used user-defined functions
 and loops. The chatbot first requested the user's name before completing three tasks, including
 predicting the user's age, counting numbers up to a certain limit, and administering a quiz.  
 
Result: The basic chatbot worked nicely and produced accurate results.
